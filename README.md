## Usage
Spires is a workflow application built to streamline the development process. Users can create and delete projects,
create tasks for each project and manage them through an interactive kanban board, as well as leave comments and reply to comments
on each project.

Projects can be given specified "due dates" and "due times" to keep users on track to meet their deadlines.

Tasks can be created and deleted for each project. Each task can be set between "available"(not started), "in progress"(working on),
or "completed"(task finished).

## Build Notes
This is a full-stack application built using React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Express, Node, Knex, and PostgreSQL. The API was built following RESTful API principles.
